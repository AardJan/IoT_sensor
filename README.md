# Overview
Microcontrollers need to send data from sensors through WiFi to destination IP (server) in JSON format.

## Requirements
#### Tools & stuff
- Soldering station
- Soldering tin
- Wire

#### Boards & Sensors
- Arduino board (or compatible)
- Sensors (look table below)

## Version
Probably this repo will by contain more code for different birds and sensors, below table contain all folders with short descriptions.
